Ellen Charles owns Treat Time, a pet supply store that specializes in high-quality cat supplies.

She’s hired us to build a website for Treat Time.

Treat Time opened in Seattle last year. It offers the largest selection of cat treats and toys in the Northwest- including over 100 different varieties of catnip filled toy mice!  They also carry a huge selection of natural, organic, raw, and grain free foods. Treat Time’s focus is the health and happiness of cats.

Ellen usually brings at least one of her cats to the store each day, so customers can hang out with cats while they shop. Brutus, in the photo, is a favorite of visitors. He will do a somersault for treats!

Treat Time expects people to visit its site to see the hours and location, view product lists, and check in on their favorite store cats. There will be no e-commerce aspect to the site.

Store customers are united by their love of cats, and willingness to spend a bit more to get products that are better for their cats. They are often well-educated and have a higher than average income.
